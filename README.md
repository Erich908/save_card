# Save Card
## Take Home Assessment for Rank Interactive

This project is created with the purpose of completing a take home assessment for Rank Interactive. This is an app that allows admins to valid a bank card and save it on the phone's local storage if it is a valid card.

## Features

- Validate Bank Cards
- Delete saved cards
- Read in card numbers by scanning it
- Configure valid countries to avoid validating cards from banned  countries

I only used the following 3rd party packages:
